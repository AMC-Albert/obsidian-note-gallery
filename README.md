## Credits

This is my first plugin and I've learned a lot and borrowed code from the following projects I've learned a lot and I highly recommend that you check them out, because they are amazing:
- [lucaorio/obsidian-image-gallery: A zero setup masonry image gallery for Obsidian](https://github.com/lucaorio/obsidian-image-gallery/tree/main)
- [nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor: Transform the Page Preview hover into a working editor instance](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor/tree/master)
